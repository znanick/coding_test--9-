Edit distance

In this project edit distance is implemented:

_Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character_

How to run:
npm start -- wordone wordtwo

You should make the code look and feel better than it is right now.
Here is a list of points:
- Check current algorithm implementation (no coding needed here)
- Refactor code (changes could be in anything)
- Add tests, you can add any testing library as you want
